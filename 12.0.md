# Release notes for FreeBSD 12.0 #

### Graphics ###
FreeBSD has changed the way graphics drivers are handled on amd64 and i386.
Graphics drivers for modern ATI/AMD and Intel graphics cards are available in ports.
The old base drivers are still available and will be installed by default, but they may not support more modern graphics cards.

In most cases it is enough to install `graphics/drm-kmod` from ports or packages to get a driver appropriate for the system, and then add the appropriate driver to `kld_list` in `/etc/rc.conf`.
For Intel (i915) it looks like this: `kld_list=/boot/modules/i915kms.ko`
For ATI/AMD graphics card, instead use `kld_list=/boot/modules/amdgpu.ko` for more recent cards, or `kld_list=/boot/modules/radeonkms.ko` for older cards.

#### Known Issues ####
When using the graphics drivers from base, or from `graphics/drm-legacy-kmod`, there are know issues with the xserver driver in `x11-drivers/xf86-video-ati`, please use `xf86-video-ati-legacy` instead.
When booting with UEFI and using the ATI/AMD graphics driver, the screen may be garbled before the appropriate driver is loaded.

#### More information ####
More information and further details can be found on the FreeBSD graphics team [wiki](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Graphics "FreeBSD Graphics Wiki").
